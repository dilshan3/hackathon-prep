# GitHub Actions Setup - Simple Version

## ✅ What I've Done

1. **Deleted all old workflow files** - Clean slate
2. **Created one simple workflow** - `.github/workflows/main.yml`
3. **Simplified the configuration** - Easy to debug

## 🚀 The New Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/main.yml`

**What it does**:
- ✅ **Triggers on**: Push to `main`, `master`, or `develop` branches
- ✅ **Tests**: Installs dependencies, generates Prisma client, builds project
- ✅ **Deploys**: Only on `main` or `master` branch (if you have Vercel secrets set up)

## 🔧 Next Steps

### 1. Check Your Branch
```bash
git branch
```

### 2. If Git is not installed:
- Download Git from: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Install it
- Restart your terminal

### 3. Push to GitHub
```bash
# Add all files
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Add simple GitHub Actions workflow"

# Push to your branch (replace 'main' with your actual branch name)
git push origin main
```

### 4. Check GitHub Actions
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click the **Actions** tab
3. You should see "CI/CD Pipeline" workflow running

## 🧪 Testing the Workflow

The workflow will:
1. **Install dependencies** - `npm ci`
2. **Generate Prisma client** - `npx prisma generate`
3. **Build the project** - `npm run build`
4. **Show success messages** - ✅ Build completed successfully!

## 🔍 If It Still Doesn't Work

### Check These Things:

1. **Repository Settings**:
   - Go to your repo → Settings → Actions → General
   - Make sure "Allow all actions and reusable workflows" is selected

2. **Branch Name**:
   - Make sure you're pushing to `main`, `master`, or `develop`
   - If using a different branch, update the workflow file

3. **File Location**:
   - The workflow file must be at: `.github/workflows/main.yml`
   - Check that the file exists in your repository

4. **YAML Syntax**:
   - The workflow file has valid YAML syntax
   - No syntax errors

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

1. **Check GitHub Status**: https://www.githubstatus.com/
2. **Look at the Actions tab** - Any error messages?
3. **Try a simple test** - Make a small change and push again

## 📋 Required GitHub Secrets (for deployment)

If you want the deployment to work, you need these secrets in your GitHub repository:

1. Go to your repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Add these secrets:
   - `VERCEL_TOKEN`
   - `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
   - `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`

## 🎯 Success Indicators

When the workflow works, you'll see:
- ✅ Workflow appears in the Actions tab
- ✅ Green checkmark when it completes
- ✅ Success messages in the logs

**The workflow is now much simpler and should definitely trigger!** 🚀
